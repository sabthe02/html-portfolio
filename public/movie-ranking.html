<h1>Best Movies according to Sabine</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lord of the rings trilogy</h3>
<p>Epic science fiction trilogy with nice music, battle action and also awarded many oscars</p>

<h3>Harry Potter saga</h3>
<p>Multiple fantasy films that see the protagonists grow. First ones are nice for children, later ones are for older people as well.</p>

<h3>The Hobit trilogy</h3>
<p>Another triolgy that I quite like from the same filmmakers as Lord of the Rings in the same universe. Epic, battle-loaden and creative</p>

<h4>You see, I've quite a thing for fantasy and science-fiction ;-)</h4>
