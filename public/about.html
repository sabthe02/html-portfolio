<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a computer science student with React and Node.JS as well as C/C++ and MySQL, MongoDB/Postgres knowledge who is highly responsible, reliable, accountable, a fast learner, good communicator and enjoys working in a team.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I'll be probably hanging out on the promenade with mate tea and some friends, playing volleyball or just lie on the beach (in summer). I also have two adorable cats that I enjoy having around :-)</p>

<p>Some of my passions are languages, so I have been studying English (C2) and French (B2) for some time. Apart from that, I am a native German speaker and since I live in Uruguay for many years, I am also completely fluent in Spanish.</p>
